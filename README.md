# Changing-Majors

This platform is meant to provide options of possible majors that undergraduates could switch to based on their credits completed and their time left in their university.

This project came about from the time when I was thinking of swithcing majors, but the contraint of time did not give me the opportunity to just blindly switch to any major; I could only switch majors for which I'd graduate on time.  Since my school did not have any tools resembling this, I decided to create it. 


This platforms should idealy use the schools API, then it would try to asses if classes (that are sequential) could be done within the alloted time. 

For instance: 

Miguel, is a Junior, wantst to switch majors and some of the classes that he completed are: Psych 101, Calc 101, Calc 102, Calc 103. 
He'd like to switch to Computer Science, but because the classes that are needed to get a Computer Science are CS101, CS 102, and CS200. He could not switch becuase the sequence could not be completed within his time window.
However the majors that are given to him are: Math, Economics, Psychology.
